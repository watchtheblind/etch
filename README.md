# Etch-A-Sketch.
💡 My Etch-A-Sketch project from "The Odin Project" 💡

Technologies used: 

-Bootstrap 📚

-HTML 📃

-Javascript 🧠

-CSS 🖌

In order to accomplish the task given by The Odin Project, i made a library that's able to create, delete and edit a series of books, only with DOM and Javascript's objects.
In this project, app.js is in charge of generating every book card and modify them at user's will, while the HTML file is the structure of the document, where styles are also applied using bootstrap's properties for a quicker making of the project.
Feel free to download and edit this code as you need. Greetings! 🙏
